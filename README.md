# Wordle-Cpp
Wordle Game made in C++
This project is a console-based word-guessing game implemented in C++. The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list, and the player has to guess the correct word within a limited number of attempts. After each guess, the program provides feedback on the correctness of the guessed letters, indicating correct letters in the correct positions (in green), correct letters in the wrong positions (in yellow), and incorrect letters (in red). The player wins if they correctly guess the word or loses if they exhaust all attempts.
